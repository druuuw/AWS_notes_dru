# Module 1

## Section 1: Intro to Cloud Computing

### Cloud Computing

- the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via internet w pay-as-you-go pricing.
- enables us to think of infrastructure as software

### Traditional computing model

- infrastructure thought of as hardware
- require physical hardware solutions
    - space
    - staff
    - physical security
    - planning
    - capital expenditure
- long hardware procurement cycle
- requires you to provision capacity by guessing theoretical max peaks
    - resources may not be enough / not be used

### Cloud computing model

- infrastructure thought of as software
- software solutions
    - flexible
    - change more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than hardware solutions
    - eliminates the undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks (i.e. procurement, maintenance etc.)

### Cloud service models

************IaaS (infrastructure as a service)************

- basic building blocks for cloud IT
- provide access to networking features, computers, data storage spaces.
- highest level of flexibility / most control

**PaaS (platform as a service)**

- reduces need for managing underlying infrastructure (hardware and OS)
- focus on deployment & management

**SaaS (software as a service)**

- provides us w completed product (provider runs and manages)
- End-user applications (i.e. Netflix, gmail etc.)
- Least control

### Cloud computing deployment models

**********Cloud**********

- fully deployed in cloud
- all parts of the app run in the cloud

************Hybrid************

- way to connect infrastructure & applications btwn cloud-based resources and existing resources not located in e cloud

******************************************************On-premises (private cloud)******************************************************

- Deployed using virtualization & resource management tools
- does not provide many  benefits of cloud computing

## Section 2: Advantages of cloud computing

- Pay only for the amount you consume
- Massive economies of scale
    - achieve lower variable cost
    - usage from hundreds of thousands of customers
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers\
- Go global in minutes

## Section 3: Intro to Amazon Web Services

### Web service

- any piece of software made available over internet
- uses standardized format (i.e. Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for request & response of an Application Programming Interface (API) interaction

### What is AWS?

- secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products
- on-demand access to computer, storage, network, database, and other IT resources and management tools
- offers flexibility
- pay only for services you need
- work tgt like building blocks

### 3 ways to interact with AWS

- AWS Management Console
    - easy to use graphical interface
- Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
    - access to services using discrete command scripts
- Software Development Kits (SDKs)
    - access services directly from code

## Section 4: Moving to the AWS Cloud â€” AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

- provides guidance and best practices to help organizations build comprehensive approach to cloud computing across the organization and throughout IT lifecycle to accelerate successful cloud adoption

### 6 core perspectives

****************Business****************

- Business
    - ensuring IT is aligned w business needs
- People
    - prioritize training, staffing, and organizational changes
- Governance
    - skills and processes align IT strategy and goals

******************Technical******************

- Platform
    - understand & communicate nature of IT systems and their relationships
    - describe architecture of target state environment
- Security
    - meet security objectives
- Operations
    - define day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, & year-to-year will be conducted
